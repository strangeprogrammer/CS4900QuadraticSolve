Notes to self: (DMD)

  + mock_quadratic is finished
  + mock_linear is  finished

  - t files do not compile due to current cunit lib?
  - Compiling t1 will not work for some reason - count init()
  - t1 file needs work
  - t2 file needs equal amount of work
  - makefile probably needs some work as well
  - get "warning: mock_quadratic.o: 'linker' input unused [-Wunused-command-line-		argument]" this warning when compiling mock_quadratic
