All automation is done through the makefile.

Testing: We use automated testing for unit testing.  To compile and run these tests:
- Go to src directory
- Type command "make test"

*If there are any errors in the test the file and line number in which that test failed will be printed to the console and stored in the cunitLog.txt file.
*If the tests all pass there is nothing outputted to the console.


Compiling: The compiling of all files is done with automation so that nobody has to compile each file indivdually. To compile quad solver:
- Go to src directory
- Type command "make"


Running: To run the program after installed, follow these steps:
- Go to any directory
- Type command "quadsolve a b c" where a b and c are real numbers

If not installed take the following steps:
- Go to src directory
- Compile quadsolve (directions above)
- Type command "./quadsolve a b c" where a b and c are real numbers
